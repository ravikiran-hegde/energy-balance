Some possible ways to experiment/extend the model

1. Add shortwave absorption
2. Account for the atmospheric lapse rate, i.e., RCE
3. Add clouds: One could add a cloud fraction parameter to incorporate clouds. Clouds could be modelled as a gray body at a fixed temperature in addition to the gray clersky atmosphere.
4. Calculate meridional temperature profiles: Make meridonal/zonal energy balance models by considering the effcetive area for incoming solar and outgoing thermal emissions. 
5. Extraplanetory affairs: chcek how the energy balances would look like for a different star or planet. How would it look when the Sun turns into a red giant?
